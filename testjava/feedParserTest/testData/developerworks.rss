<title>Build installation packages with solution installation and deployment technologies</title>
<description>The solution installation and deployment technologies in the Autonomic Computing Toolkit is the set of tools for installing, updating, and removing software packages. It provides a common technology across all supported platforms to allow developers to check for installation software and hardware dependencies, and specify where the package components are installed. The system administrator no longer has to do all the dependency research before installation; the developer has automated it for them, although the advanced system administrator retains the ability to customize their installation.  This tutorial is about creating solution installation and deployment packages. Two examples are given: a minimal, one file "Hello World" installation and a more complex scenario. The complex example looks at the IBM supplied solution installation and deployment scenario for InstallAnywhere that installs the WebSphere Application Server (WAS Express 5.0). It has dependency checks (both built-in and external), it installs individual files or directories of files, and in most desktop environments, it installs desktop shortcuts.</description>
